Layout Sections:

Header: A simple, sticky top bar with the BizNews logo on the left and a navigation menu on the right.

Main Content Area: This is a grid layout that takes up the majority of the page.

News Articles: The left side of the screen (on larger desktops) displays the news content. It includes a large, prominent featured article at the top and smaller, text-based articles below.

Chatbot Panel: The right-side panel is dedicated to the chatbot. It is styled as a separate, elevated card. It has a header with the bot's name and a main area that scrolls to display the conversation. An input box at the bottom allows the user to type and send messages. On mobile, this panel is designed to be collapsible.

Styling and Aesthetics:

Color Palette: A professional combination of deep indigo (#4F46E5), subtle grays, and white backgrounds.

Typography: The font is 'Inter' for a modern and highly readable feel.

Design Elements: The design uses rounded corners and soft shadows to give elements a clean, card-like appearance.
